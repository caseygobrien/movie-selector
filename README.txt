The Movie Selector allows you to create a list of movies
you would like to watch, and then select a random movie from
the list on a movie night.
It also lets you record a movie as watched and adds it to a
separate text file with the date appended. Each year it will
create a separate watched file for you so you will have a record
of every movie you have seen that year.
